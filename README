1. INTRODUCTION
=============================================================================


Grails is a web application framework based on the Groovy language that endorses the DRY (don't repeat yourself) and coding-by-convention philosophies. Grails runs on the Java Virtual Machine and thus has access to the entire Java Platform.

With Grails you can easily create web applications thanks to:

- a complete development and deployment environment. All dependencies and configuration that is required to the run Grails applications in a web server are provided by Grails. The only thing you have to worry about is your application code.

- inclusion of an embedded Jetty web server

- development mode that automatically reloads changes made to application code, without having to restart the web server.

- automatic persistence mapping of domain classes with automatic relationship management.

- scaffolding on data access classes for rapid development of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- powerful view technology with dynamic tag libraries and support for Groovy Server Pages (GSP)


2. GETTING STARTED
=============================================================================


To get started follow these steps:

- create a GRAILS_HOME environment variable that points to the path of the Grails distribution (the folder contain this file).

- add the bin folder in the Grails distribution to the PATH environment variable

On a Windows computer these step are done as follows:

> set GRAILS_HOME=C:\download\grails
> echo %GRAILS_HOME%
C:\download\grails
> set PATH=%GRAILS_HOME%\bin;%PATH%

On a Unix-like computer these steps are done as follows:

> set GRAILS_HOME=~/download/grails
> export GRAILS_HOME
> echo ${GRAILS_HOME}
~/download/grails
> cd ${GRAILS_HOME}
> chmod a+x bin/grails
> set PATH=${GRAILS_HOME}/bin:${PATH}
